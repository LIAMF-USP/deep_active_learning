a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend of course the sob is very good-looking , charming , etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman watching jean pierre leaud 's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends it 's tragic , and you know she 's going to end up very hurt , but there 's nothing you can do leaud is brilliant totally empty a blank throughout , he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love , and the next morning he puts on a record and , very sweetly and charmingly , sings along to amuse her is brilliant the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come it 's a long film , but see it in one go , preferably in a cinema takes a while to get into , but then the time just disappears
